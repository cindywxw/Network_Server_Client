There are three files: WebServer.java ClientHandler.java HTTPResponse.java
To compile and run the project:

$ javac *.java
$ java WebServer â€”-port=1234

The web root folder is www by default in the same folder of the files.

(In HTTPResponse.java, line 119-122 that I commented out are just used to print out the response to POST and invalid requests in the terminal.)

Thanks!
